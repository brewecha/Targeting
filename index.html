        <h3><u>DIV</u></h3>

        <p>A "div" is an element with no style and no real purpose. It is 
            used as just an open container</p>

        <div>GO</div>

        <div>STOP</div>

        <h3><u>ID</u></h3>

        <p>An ID allows you to target a specific elemnt and attach css 
            stylings to JUST THAT ELEMENT WITH THAT ID. In CSS, ids are 
            targeted using the # sign. ids can be given to ANY ELEMENT.</p>

        <div id='go'>GO</div>
        <div id='stop'>STOP</div>
