            <h1>Some of My Favorite Songs of All Time</h1>
            <p class='quotes'>Music is very important to me, it helps to focus and even helps me 
                through hard times. I have had music in my life for the longest, 
                I can't remember a time when music wasn't played on a daily in my house.
                I feel that music can bring us all together.</p>
